两个定义：

- Arthur Samuel (1959) ：机器学习是gives computers the ability to learn, without being explicitly programmed.

- Tom Mitchell (1998) : "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E." 经验E，评价函数P，事件T。
